	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>I am exploring a dataset which provides fuel economy information for cars from 1984 to the current year.I want to see if, in general, cars have become more efficient in saving money by comparing the MPG of cars through the years and how much oil a car consumes on average per year.<p>
	<p>Thus I am choosing these visualizations in order to provide an answer to this. The visualizations will allow for some filtering by range of year and by which class of vehicle a user is interested in (vans, compact cars, two seaters, etc.)<p>
	<h3>Completed Features</h3>
	<p>I've finished these visualizations markups in tableau to give a general idea of the trends I can touch on in my commentary of the data. I have attached two versions of each visualization to show what filtering will look like as well.<p>
	<h3>Upcoming Milestones</h3>
	<p>I will now implement these designs in D3. I will first focus on getting the visualizations done, and then begin working on the filtering options<p>
	<h3>Roadblocks</h3>
	<p>I have not hit any crazy rodeblocks, but I have decided to change my visualizations slightly from how I initially planned. I had previously planned to use some form of ranking of the vehicle class to determine the coloring of my points, but think using point density to create my colors would be a better way of showing more data and removing clutter.</p>

	    <h3>Rubric Content</h3>
	    <p>In visualizations 1 and 2, I have elected to go for color scheme based on the density of the points. The color it is based on is arbitrary, I chose green because it's about money. Perhaps I could implement an on hover of one point, change the color scheme of all the other points of the same vehicle class.</p>
	    <p>In regards to data density, I believe the color density will help deal with the large amount of data. I had changed visualization 2 from a mirror bar chart type of thing to be more of a density scatter plot to deal with this.</p>
	    <p>Aesthetics are hard to comment on because tableau usually makes clean visualizations. I'd like to keep this cleanliness into my D3 versions.<p>
	    <p>In terms of lying, I'm not sure yet if I can say that cars have gotten better over time just based on technology, etc. As I dig into the data more and visualize it further, perhaps I will change my thesis to say "oh, actually cars have improved in general somewhat, but really we've begun building more compact cars instead of gas guzzlers like trucks and vans which explains these numbers".</p>
	    <p>I believe the main visual encoding is the color, the density color scheme, to show where the biggest trends are.</p>
